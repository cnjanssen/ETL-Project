## Project Proposal

As a Data Enthusiasts, we challenged ourselves to find out different datasets of a major city and merge the data and make sense of it or find any correlation or causation based on the data.

Each one of us were assigned with a task of

-	Extracting interesting/useful data from websites such as NYC Open Data and Kaggle 
-	Transforming the data by
	-	Removing unwanted columns
	-	Replacing/Removing unknown/Null values with valid values
	-	Adding new fields to help with the analysis (extracted Year from Date)
	-	Filling the missing data with 0 (ex: zipcode )
-	Loading it in tables to do the analysis
	-	Designing the tables including junction tables
	-	Creating Schemas for the tables
	-	Creating tables
	-	Loading the data
	
## Files for NYCCollisions are available at this other repo https://github.com/ibawany65/etl-project.git due to github space restrcitions and LFS limits.

## File For NY Restaurant Inspection are available at other repo https://github.com/congntran92/ETL_Project.git due to github space limit.

## Files for CRIME and PARKING_TICKETS are available in other repo https://github.com/SharmaBhumi/ETL_proj as github repo restricts the size of uploads and LFS also has limits
